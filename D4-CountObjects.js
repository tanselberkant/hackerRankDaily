// Objective

// In this challenge, we learn about iterating over objects. Check the attached tutorial for more details.

Task;

// Complete the function in the editor.
// It has one parameter: an array, a, of objects. Each object in the array has two integer properties denoted by x and y.
// The function must return a count of all such objects o in array a that satisfy o.x == o.y.

function getCount(objects) {
  let count = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < objects.length; i++) {
    if (objects[i].x == objects[i].y) {
      count++;
    }
  }
  return count;
}
